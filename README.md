# LightningNerf
Have you ever been paranoid of lightning strikes burning down forests and/or builds in your b1.7.3 server? It is rare, but possible, if the fire has the chance to spread to a block covered from the rain. On 24/7 servers this becomes more likely to happen eventually.

This plugin simply cancels all fires caused by lighting, otherwise lightning behaves in the same way.

## Config Options

- `quiet-mode: false` - By default the plugin will announce when it cancels a lightning fire and provides the coordinates. During thunderstorms this can become quite spammy in the server log and some lightning strikes might cause multiple fires on the same block. This option disables these log messages.
